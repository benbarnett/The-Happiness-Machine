* port funnel UI classes (as3) to javascript:
    - Accelerometer
    - Button
    - DCMotor
    - LED
    - RGBLED
    - Servo
    - SoftPot

* decide on and implement namespacing scheme

* align code to js best practices

* create a few practical examples (current examples simply print to console)

* create minified library

* create simple gui-based server application
	- cross platform
	- easy to install
	- gui to select serial port and baud rate
	- support multiple Arduino connections simultaneously?
